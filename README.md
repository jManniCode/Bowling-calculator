HOW TO PLAY:

There is a possibility that you will need to run these commands in the CLIENT folder:" npm install react@^19 react-dom@^19 @types/react@^19 @types/react-dom@^19 " , " npm install react-router ".
BUT hopefully it's enough with " npm install " in the CLIENT folder

THEN
1. Start the Server:
    Open a terminal, navigate to the projects server folder,
     and run the command:
      " dotnet run "
         This will start the backend server.

2.Start the Client:
    Open a new terminal, navigate to the projects client folder, and run:
     " npm run dev "
        This will start the frontend development server. Once it starts, copy the URL provided 
          (for example, http://localhost:5173) and open it in your browser.

3.Using the Application:
  When the application loads, you'll see your scoreboard. 
    Click the "Roll" button to simulate bowling rolls.
       Your score will update in real time as you roll.

Enjoy playing around with it!
